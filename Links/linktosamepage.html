<h2 id="Pawn">Pawn</h2>
<p>Pawn moves straight and captures in crossward direction or diagonally.</p>
<h2 id="Bishop">Bishop</h2>
<p>Bishop moves and captures diagonally respective to its colour boxes.</p>
<h2 id="Knight">Knight</h2>
<p>Knight proceeds via 2 and half move <abbr title="that is ">i.e</abbr> making L shape.</p>
<h2 id="Rook">Rook</h2>
<p>Rook advances with plus sign moving in forward and sideward direction which makes it more stronger than knight and bishop!</p>
<h2 id="Queen">Queen</h2>
<p>It's the most essential piece of any chess game played it advances diagonally as well as in plus sign similarly showing the combined effect of rook and bishop it has in total 9 points which makes it the most essential and powerfull piece on the board</p>
<h2 id="King">King</h2>
<p>As the name suggest it is the most vital piece it is not captured but it is checkmated which we will talk in later webpages it is in the sense make to stop moving by letting no places to make it moves
By the way talking about its advancing stratery it moves only one step direction in not the barrier here it can like the queen just one step but when it has no places left of no check places left it is checkmated and the game ends.  </p>
